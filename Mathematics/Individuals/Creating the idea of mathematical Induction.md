> [!Theorem]+
> Suppose for each $n\in\N_0$ that $P(n)$ is a proposition (a verbal statement or a formula) that satisfies the following two properties: 
> 1. $P(0)$ is true
> 2. For every $k\in\N_0$ for which $P(k)$ is true, $P(k+1)$ is also true.
>
> Then for every integer $n\in\N_0$ the proposition $P(n)$ is true.
