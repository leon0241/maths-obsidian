###### [[Subgroups]]
> [!Definition]
> Let $G$ be a [[Groups|group]]. We say that a non-empty subset $H$ of $G$ is a *subgroup* of $G$ if $H$ itself is a group (under the operation from $G$). We write $H\le G$ if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. If also $H\ne G$, we write $H<G$ and say that $H$ is a proper subgroup
