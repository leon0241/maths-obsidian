###### [[Dihedral Group]]
> [!Definition]+
> The dihedral group $D_{n}$ is the group of the symmetries of a n-gon. 
> e.g. $D_{3}$ is the symmetries of a triangle, so it consists of $$D_{3} = \{e,\,g,\,g^{2},\,h,\,hg,\,hg^{2}\}$$
> where $e$ is the identity, $g$ represents a rotation of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, and $h$ is a reflection
