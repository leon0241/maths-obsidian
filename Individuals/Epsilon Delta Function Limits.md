> Let $f:A\to\R$ and let $c$ be a limit point of $A$. Then we say that
> $$\displaystyle\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$$
> if for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists some $\delta>0$ such that for every $x\in A$ for which $0<\lvert x-c \rvert<\delta$, we have
> $$\lvert f(x)-L \rvert<\epsilon $$
> We also say $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to c}f(x)$ *converges* to L in such a situation

> The reason we requiree that $x\in A$ is just so that $f(x)$ makes sense, since
