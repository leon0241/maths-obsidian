###### [[Isomorphism]]
> [!Definition]+
> An *isomorphism* between two graphs is a [[Functions#Functions Bijective Function|bijection]] between them that preserves all edges. More precisely, if $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$ are graphs, with sets of vertices $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ respectively, then an *isomorphism* from $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$ is a bijection
> $$f : V_{1}\to V_{2}$$
> such that $f(v_{1})$ and $f(v_{2})$ are joined by an edge if and only if $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are also joined by an edge.
> We say that $\Gamma_{1}$ and $\Gamma_{2}$ are *isomorphic* if there exists an isomorphism $f:\Gamma_{1}\to\Gamma_{2}$
