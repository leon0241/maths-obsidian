###### [[Definition of a Ring]]
> [!Definition]+ 
> A ring is an algebraic structure that generalises [[Field Axioms of R|fields]]. Multiplication doesn't have to be commutative, and multiplicative inverses don't need to exist. Rings can numbers such as [[Defining Subsets of R (N,Z,Q)|integers]] or complex numbers, but they may also be non-numerical objects such as polynomials, square matrices, functions, and power series.
