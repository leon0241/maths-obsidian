###### [[Monotone Convergence Theorem]]
> [!Theorem]+
> If a sequence of real numbers $(s_{n})$ is increasing and bounded above, or decreasing and bounded below, then $(s_{n})$ is convergent (and converges to the [[Bounds, Suprema and Infima|supremum/infinum]] of the set $\{x_{n}\,\vert\,n\in\N\}$ respectively).
